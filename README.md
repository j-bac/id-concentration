# To do list:
- decide which estimators to keep
- decide which synthetic and real datasets to keep
- compute subsampling analysis for all synthetic and real datasets
- get raw statistics from the estimators
- compute kNN ID estimates/pointwise global estimates (for other estimators also)
- update datasets
