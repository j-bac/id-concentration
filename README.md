# To do list:
- number of points vs maximal dimension detectable (1/N) plot p estimate from above **DONE**
- show our usual separability plots **DONE**
- just for separability, 10 balls separability/global pointwise ID and local ID **just have to copy/paste**
- cartoon drawing separability from neighbors or from the rest 
- several examples with variable local ID (MNIST,Nestorowa,ISOLET)
- subsampling saturation synthetic/real/single cell
- confirm sphere and balls ID **DONE**
- separability function with bound max ID **DONE**
