%COMPUTE_BETAS Computes betas between one and max_dim. This code is based on the paper

%   DÃ­az, M., Quiroz, A., & Velasco, M. (2018). 
%   Local angles and dimension estimation from data on manifolds.
% 
%   betas = compute_betas( max_dim ) Computes the variance of the angle between two Gaussian
%   vectors in RR^d, it does so for each d between 1 and max_dim.
